Hi, I'm Jos√© Coto. I am currently based in Berlin, where I work as a Data Science freelancer. I use data for understanding social and individual behavior. In my analyses, I really enjoy working with Python and its related scientific and statistic libraries. Currently, I have started exploring Big Data tools for data analysis, as Pig and Spark.

Two of the things I enjoy the most is learning and teaching. Personally, I found it quite daunting trying to make sense of all the data analysis tools out there. I created this blog to keep track of the things I am learning with the hope it will help others too.
