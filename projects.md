	<h3>Der, die, what??</h3>
	<p>
	German is specially tough when it comes to remembering the genders of the nouns. Out of frustration, I created this game. It provides a simple interface to test the "gender skills". Users can track their progress with a series of intuitive graphs to know their daily and historical progress.

	<h3>Playing with Pandas</h3>
	<p>
 	I wanted to use python's numeric libraries as a companion to some master courses I'm currently attending. Here, you can find some notebooks and selected code related to the classes. In my posts I'll try to go into detail about the interesting things I come across.

	<h3>Teaching research methods</h3>
	<p>
 	I taught a seminar for university students on quantitative research methods. As part of the seminar I conducted a workshop on web scraping with Python. The materials and related IPython notebooks can be found here (available in Spanish.)
